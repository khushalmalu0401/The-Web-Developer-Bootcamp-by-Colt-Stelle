    <p>An elephantâ€“headed anthropomorphic figure on Indo-Greek coins from the 1st century BCE has been proposed by some
        scholars to be "incipient Ganesha", while others have suggested Ganesha may have been an emerging deity in India
        and southeast Asia around the 2nd-century CE based on the evidence from archaeological excavations in Mathura
        and outside India.<sup>[13]</sup> Most certainly by the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta period,
        Ganesha was well
        established and had inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors.<sup>[14]</sup> Hindu mythology
        identifies him as
        the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various
        traditions.<sup>[15][16]</sup> In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity.[17] The
        principal
        texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana
        and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopaedic texts that deal with Ganesh.</p>
