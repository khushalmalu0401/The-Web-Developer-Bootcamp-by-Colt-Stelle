            A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also
            called
            shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public
            stock
            exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold
            to
            investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via
            stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in
            mind.

        Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, Nestl√© and Novartis
        are
        domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, so they may be considered as part of the
        Swiss
        stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as
        American
        depositary receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.</p>
